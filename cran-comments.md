## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version we have:

* Removed the character R from the title
* Added a web reference for the API in the description of DESCRIPTION
* Written all software and API names in single quotes in title and description of DESCRIPTION
* Added CorrelAid e.V. as author with role copyright holder 'cph'

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 3.6.2
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 1 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.

* `dplyr` is added as import because `map_dfr` requires it under the hood.
