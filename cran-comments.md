## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version we have:

* Fixed a possibly invalid URL in the vignette

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 3.6.2
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 1 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.

* `dplyr` is added as import because `map_dfr` requires it under the hood.
